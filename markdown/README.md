# ![WollMux](images/Wollmux_logo_medium.gif "fig:Wollmux_logo_medium.gif") - the letterhead and form system of the LHM.

The "Eierlegende WollMux" (short: WollMux) is an extension for [LibreOffice](http://www.documentfoundation.org), which was developed by the [Landeshauptstadt MÃ¼nchen]](http://www.muenchen.de) in the context of the LiMux project. The WollMux extends LibreOffice by numerous functions, which facilitate the work with templates, forms and letterheads substantially. Da the WollMux was published as OpenSource and is freely available for everyone, it is now also used in other municipalities and companies.
